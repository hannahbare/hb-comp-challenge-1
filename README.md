# hb-comp-challenge-1
The purpose of this static comp is to practice and challenge our CSS skills. I practiced my fundamentals of CSS as well as utilized flexbox in order to achieve the design. The goal is to maintain the original design of the original static website yet was given the freedom to change the theme and colors.

I created a repo in my git and then created a repo in github in order to utilize version control.
